## Accessibility Problems
 
**1. Horizontal scrolling in *Requests* section for switching between *Pending*, *Past* and *All* section.**
 
Problem: Horizontal scrolling is not smooth. A little tilted scroll leads to the expansion of navbar and hence causing the problem.
 
<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64194946/93596527-18591e80-f9d7-11ea-84aa-7a7fa5f2f3a5.gif" height="400"></div>
 
Solution: Remove navbar expansion feature.

**2. Refresh option.**
 
Problem: In order to refresh, the user has to first click on three dots at the top-right corner and then click refresh.
 
<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64194946/93595352-39207480-f9d5-11ea-9b5b-b1eb3eac3ee6.jpg" height="400"></div>
 
Solution: Either remove the refresh button option as we already have it in the form of swipe-down or add refresh icon at the main navbar.

**3. Font Size.**
 
Problem: Font size is too big at some places.
 
Solution: Use adequate font size.
 
  <br>

**4. Profile section.**
 
Problem: The profile is displayed as a disabled form which doesn't make a good impression on the user. One has to pay more attention in order to read profile details.
 
<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64194946/93595357-3a51a180-f9d5-11ea-978a-4a23206e57e9.jpg" height="400"></div>
 
Solution: Change the layout and design of the profile section.
 
  <br>

**5. Members section.**
 
Problem: If there is no member matching the filter applied, the screen just appears blank without showing any message.
 
<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64194946/93595354-39b90b00-f9d5-11ea-8fb8-d27284945166.jpg" height="400"></div>
 
Solution: Show `No member found` if there is no member matching the applied filter.
 
 <br>
 
**6. Achievements**
 
Problem: If there is no achievement we currently display a message `No recent achievements`. This sounds somewhat negative. We should use some positive message here.
 
<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64194946/93595349-37ef4780-f9d5-11ea-80ff-3d74c5daa34b.jpg" height="400"></div>
 
Solution: Use the message `Your achievements will come here` instead.
 
 <br>

**7. Feedback page.**
 
Problem: In the feedback form we by default show the message `Email ID can't be left blank` and `Message can't be left blank`. These things are pretty obvious.

 <div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64194946/93595341-36258400-f9d5-11ea-8390-0467fa96a230.jpg" height="400"></div>

Solution: These messages should only be shown if the user tries to submit feedback with these fields blank.
