 # Performed an audit of Accessibility problems the app has, considered various scenarios that are hampering the User Experience also, mentioned ways these problems can be fixed.


- Navigation:
Currently there are two ways to refresh : by clicking on the button and swiping up. Older generation or users with disabilities may find it confusing.
  - Solution : Keep the swipe up to refresh and remove the button throught the app , with a tutorial about it's usage and bottom nav bar usage when the user logs in for the first time.

- Color :
Currently the color of title bar and the rest screen of the app is in not much of a difference , users with colorblindness may mind is difficult to differentiate and explore the app.
Speaking of same the title bar is full of more colors than expected , again users with colorblindness will find it odd and difficult.
  - Solution : Change the current title bar to a solid color .

- Unnecessary feature :
When a user is attempting to swipe up and refresh but instead swpies partially , it is seen that the title bar increases in size whereas nothing was expected to happen .In this scenerio the main goal of user was to refresh the page and not increase the size of title bar.
  - Solution : Fixing the title bar throught the app for all actions

- Font :
The font used is mostly accessible but whenthe user is on Mentoship Requests Tab>>clicks on any request - the font size is huge and incosistent with other pages.
There is no zoom button / finger action to zoom feature presently.Visually impaired users will have trouble reading and understanding 
  - Solution : Fix the Request Detail font size and add the zoom to read feature which can be shown in the tutorial when user logs in first.

- Speech aides:
Presently there is no text to speech feature or search users based on the speech input feature. In task comments , audio as well as text input feature isn't present.Not very accessible without this.
  - Solution : Add text to speech, audio search and input in app. 

- Notifications:
Currently when some other user accepts the mentorship request , an email is sent.Somecases the user may not check emails resulting in not using the app thinking about no recent activity.
But if there is a notification displayed , more engagement of user with application is possible.
  - Solution : Add notifications with proper toast messages.
