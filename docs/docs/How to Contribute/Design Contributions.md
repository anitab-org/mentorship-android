## Open Contribution Guideline in Design:

We are open for anyone to contribute to design in UI and UX. Please follow below rules.
How to contribute in designs:
* It is expected that 1 designer is contributing to the selected project.
* Join a project session to check what is needed to design, familiarise yourself with metrics guidelines if exists.
* Before starting the design make sure you contact the primary ambassador designer for the project to coordinate work which has NOT been assigned yet.
* Start design and attend design sessions regularly to get feedback.
* Once the designs are good, create issues for the developer. This issue needs to be approved by the design team member and has to contain all necessary information including margins, padding, accessibility, font metrics, colors, behaviour on size change, described expected animations, etc.
* If the project does not have a metrics document - this should be created with first design.
* Feel free to review other designers' work either on design sessions or GitHub issues and rise your concerts of inconsistency related to other designs within the project or related to metrics document. Feel free to review current state and rise design bugs if you find any.


# Open Source Ambassadors Guideline in Design:

Open Source Ambassadors is at least half year contribution program organised by AnitaB.org open source and required acceptance. As a design ambassador you will have a direct impact in shaping AnitaB.org applications in matters of UI and UX. You will be working on an assigned project, but also you will be sharing your knowledge and learning from other designers. At AnitaB.org Open Source we put loads of attention to accessibility designs. You can get more experience and grow your skills by helping shape out our projects.
