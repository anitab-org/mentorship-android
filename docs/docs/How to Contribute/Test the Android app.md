## How to test the application
Every time a new commit is merged into the `develop` branch an apk is released in the `apk` branch.

If you want to do manual testing on the application without setting up the development environment, you can download this [app-debug.apk](https://github.com/systers/mentorship-android/blob/apk/app-debug.apk) and install it on your Android device.

If you want ideas of test cases to use when testing the mobile application business logic, you can check this set of [Quality Assurance test cases](https://github.com/systers/mentorship-backend/wiki/Quality-Assurance) page from [systers/mentorship-backend](https://github.com/systers/mentorship-backend) repository.
